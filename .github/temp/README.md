## Installation

The first step will be to clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/{repo}.git
```

### For development

The requirements are:

* [Python] and [Poetry]

1. Install the dependencies
   ```shell
   poetry install
   ```

### For production

Using Docker is generally recommended (but not strictly required) because it abstracts away some additional set up work.

The requirements for Docker are:

* [Docker CE]
* [Docker Compose]
    * `pip install docker-compose`
    * This is only a required step for linux. Docker comes bundled with docker-compose on Mac OS and Windows.
